// Chapter 2
// Variables

// As previously explained variables are containers that stores some value.
//Example
let xVariable = "Purfume";
console.log(xVariable) //Expected output: Purfume

// Here "xVariable" is an identifier.
// And we have stored a string in "xVariable" (i.e) "Purfume"

// You can store any kind of data in the variable.
// (Refer Chapter 1)

//Example 1
let age = 23; // Here we stored a number
console.log(age) //Expected output: 23

//Example 2
let bookName = "The Alchemist"; // Here we stored a string
console.log(bookName) //Expected output: The Alchemist

//Example 3
let fact = true; // Here we stored a boolean
console.log(fact) //Expected output: true

//Will learn more stuff tomorrow.
