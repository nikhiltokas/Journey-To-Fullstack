# Journey to Full Stack Development

This is my first ever repository!
And it took me more than an hour just to set it up!

After investing over 3 lakhs in software developers, and ending up with more frustration than progress,
I have decided that it’s time to build my own application.
My goal is to become a full-stack developer and finally bring my idea to life.

This repository will cover all the basics I learn daily—from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and maybe even some Node.js as I progress.
If you're new to coding like me, feel free to follow along. Together, we can learn and become full-stack developers.

Fk it boys, lets do it.
Welcome to my journey to full stack!
